## About
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional underwater ROV without spending a lot of money. This means that the ROV should be able to move freely horizontally and vertically throughout a body of water and should be able to send and record live video.

## Overview
In order to complete the goal several components must be considered: lateral control, depth control, hull/configuration, power, communication, and video.
#### Lateral Control
To move freely in a body of water most ROVs use thrusters in a variety of configurations for maneuverability. There are three commonly used configurations for ROV propulsion each of which has its own influence on the power, electronics, and number of thrusters needed to function. The first configuration utilizes two thrusters in the same orientation situated on each side of the ROV as is shown below.

This configuration uses differential control for turning and drives both thrusters at the same level for forward and reverse. The benefit of this propulsion configuration is that it is very simple in terms of thrusters, electronics, and power. The main drawback is that this configuration is less maneuverable and generally less powerful than other configurations.
