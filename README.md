## About
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional underwater ROV without spending a lot of money. This means that the ROV should be able to move freely horizontally and vertically throughout a body of water and should be able to send and record live video.

## Overview
In order to complete the goal several components must be considered: lateral control, depth control, hull/configuration, power, communication, and video.
